# User Authentication Instructions

## Initial Setup
When starting the app for the first time or on a new device, shared preferences will be empty. As per project specifications, user data is stored using shared preferences, so you'll need to log in or sign up.

## Test User Credentials
Use the following test user credentials to log in:
- **Email:** test@test.com
- **Password:** test123

## Sign-Up Functionality
If you want to try out the sign-up functionality, ensure you use a proper email format and a password with at least 6 characters. Double-check for any spelling errors.

## Note
Every user has the same role, so your account will be the same as test@test.com.
